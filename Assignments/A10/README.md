## List Homework - Just do it
Due: never

#### Overview 

>Using the code from [here](https://github.com/rugbyprof/1063-Data-Structures/tree/master/Lectures/L12), add code to keep track of the lists current size. We don't currently have a remove yet, but we will next time we meet. So the list currently can only get bigger :)  

>There is currently a data member in the code called `listSize` which I forgot to implement in class. So, you can use it as a homework. 

>If your going to keep track of the `listSize`, you should probably also add a method that returns the list size when called.
