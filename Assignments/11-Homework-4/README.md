# CS 1063 Program 4

### Game of Life Fixes
***Due: 1 May 2016***

### Overview
You are going to add a few fixes to our game of life solution: 

### Requirements:
- Turn our world into a never ending plane. Meaning if a life form falls off of the world at any of the extremes, it will be transported to the opposite side and not just disappear.
- Add the functionality to "stop" the evolving if the world has reached a "stable" state. This means, no changes occured between 2 consecutive generations.
- Add a function to create a "glider gun" on your world.

### Deliverables

- Place your code in a folder called **`program_4`** in your **`assignments`** folder.
- There should be a `cpp` file called `gameoflife.cpp`
- I will compile your code, and run it on my machine. 
- If the folders or files are not named correctly multiply your program grade by **`.5`**.
- Have your main program read in a file called **`gen_one.txt`** that will have a representation of the 1<sup>st<sup> generation for your program to start with.
