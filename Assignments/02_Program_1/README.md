## Program 1 - Image Flipper
Due February 3<sup>rd</sup> at the beginning of class.

### Overview

This course is about data structures, but were going to start with a concept that you should have ended 
with last semester, 2D arrays. There is a starter file in this folder that will read in an image that has
been stored in a txt format. It doesn't manipulate the data at all, it simply turns around and writes the
image right back to a new file. Your job will be to write a function that will "flip" your image either
horizontally or vertically depending on some user input. This won't be real fun unless we can work with
real images, so I wrote a small web page that lets you convert images to text and back again. It lives 
here: http://cs.mwsu.edu/~griffin/1063_DataStructures/imgcsv/. And since it allows uploads, it has a username/password associated with it: ***mustang/mustang***. 

### Image Arrays

We can think of an image as a two dimensional array of RGB values. We've discussed this in class.
