## Program 1 - Image Manipulation
Due February 3<sup>rd</sup> at the beginning of class.

### Overview

This course is about data structures, but were going to start with a concept that you should have ended 
with last semester, 2D arrays. There is a starter file in this folder that will read in an image that has
been stored in a txt format. It doesn't manipulate the data at all, it simply turns around and writes the
image right back to a new file. 

Your job for this assignment will be to write two functions. One that will "flip" your image either
horizontally or vertically depending on some user input. And another function to turn your image into
gray scale. 

This won't be real fun unless we can work with real images, so I wrote a small web page that lets you convert 
images to text and back again. It lives here: http://cs.mwsu.edu/~griffin/1063_DataStructures/imgcsv/. And since 
it allows uploads, it has a username/password associated with it: ***mustang/mustang***. 

### Image Arrays

We can think of an image as a two dimensional array of RGB values. We've discussed this in class.
