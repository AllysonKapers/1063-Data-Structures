Homework 1 - EndSert Method
==========
Due: February 10th by Class time.

## Overview
- Using the [starter.cpp](./starter.cpp) file, add a method called **`EndSert`** that uses a ***tail*** pointer to insert a node at the tail end of the list.
- This means you will need to keep the tail pointer always pointed at the last node. This is not to difficult since you would only need to move the ***tail*** pointer if you use your **`EndSert`** method. Obviously, you need to point ***tail*** to the very first node added to the list as well (see below).
- On the insertion of the value 18, using the **`FrontSert`** or **`EndSert`** methods would result in the same outcome if that value is the first value being added to the list (in regards to the ***head*** and ***tail*** pointers)

## Deliverables

- Create a file called `tail_insertion.cpp` and place your solution in this file.
- Add your `tail_insertion.cpp` to your `Assignments` folder.
