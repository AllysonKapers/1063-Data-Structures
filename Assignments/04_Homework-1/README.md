Homework 1
==========

- Using the [starter.cpp](./starter.cpp) file, add a method called **`EndSert`** that uses the ***tail*** pointer to insert a node at the tail end of the list.
- This means you will need to keep the tail pointer always pointed at the last node. This is not to difficult since you would only need to move the ***tail*** pointer if you use your **`EndSert`** method. Obviously, you need to point ***tail*** to the very first node added to the list as well.
