## Test 1 - Functions and Arrays and some Structs

#### Arrays

- Do [Homework 1](https://github.com/rugbyprof/1063-Data-Structures/tree/master/Assignments/A02)
- Do [Homework 2](https://github.com/rugbyprof/1063-Data-Structures/tree/master/Assignments/A03)
- Be able to dynamically allocate memory for a single dimensional array.
- Be able to dynamically allocate memory for a two dimensional array.

#### Functions using Arrays :)
- Write a function that sums up all the integers in a single dimensional array and returns the sum.
- Write a function that finds the smallest value in a 2D array of ints, and returns the smallest value.
- Write a function to add up and average the even locations in some array. 
- Given two arrays: ***A, B*** (assume they are the same size), write a function to copy the data from ***A*** to ***B***.
- Given two arrays: ***A, B*** (assume they are the same size), write a function to copy the data from ***A*** to ***B*** but in reverse order.
- Write a function that will open a file and read the values (1 per line) into some array. 

- Given:

```cpp
struct Stats{
  int min;
  int max;
  double avg;
};
```

- Write a function that finds the min, max, and avg of some given array, and returns the calculated values in a struct like the one above.
