## Homework 04 - Overloading and Queues
#### Due: October 15<sup>th</sup> by class time.

### Overview

Edit the [ListQueue.hpp](../../Lectures/L08/ListQueue.hpp) file, and alter the queue so that it accepts Animals just like the L07 stack did and not integers.


### Deliverables

- Create a folder called `homework_04` in your `assignments` folder.
- In this folder make sure you have (same files as L08) + `animals.txt`:
  - `animals.txt`
  - `ListQueue.hpp`
  - `main.cpp`
- Edit the ListQueue and main so that the queue will accept animals and not integers.
- What to print out:
  - Print `main.cpp` 
  - Print `ListQueue.hpp`
- Both of those files should be turned in at the beginning of class.
- Make sure comments are included as well!
