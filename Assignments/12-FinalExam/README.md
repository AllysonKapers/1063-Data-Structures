## Arrays

## Lists

- What is the worst case search time for a singly linked list? Discuss what advantages / disadvantages a doubly linked list would have for: (1) Searching (2) Inserting (3) Deleting

- Write a c++ function the will return the largest and smallest values from any given linked list.
 - Write a function to merge two linked lists of integers that are sorted into ascending order. The result should be a third linked list that is the sorted combination of the original lists. Do not destroy the original lists. Do not assume you have a class with methods to complete this problem.

 ```cpp
Node * List1; //points to List1 above
Node * List2; //points to List2 above
Node * List3; //currently points to NULL;
List3 = MergeLists(List1,List2); //function call to merge the lists.

//Your function will receive two Node*â€™s and return a 3rd Node* that points to your new merged list.

Node* MergeLists(Node* L1, Node* L2){
