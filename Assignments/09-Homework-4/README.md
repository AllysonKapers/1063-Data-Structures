## Homework 4
**Fixing the binary search**

***Due: By Wednesday the 8<sup>th</sup> classtime.***

- Using the code from class [here](./main.cpp) fix the binary search function so that it will handle searching for a key that does NOT exist.
- Bring a printout of your program to class on Wednesday.
- I will go over the fix, so late homeworks will not be accepted.
