## Extra Credit - Fix the list insert method
#### Due: Friday February 23<sup>rd</sup> by 10:00am

- Simply fix the insert method so that it is not "leaking" memory.
- Currently it works for:
    - empty list
    - list with one item
- However for `N > 2` it starts losing the N<sub>-1</sub> node.

#### Deliverables
- If you decide to do the extra credit, bring a print out of YOUR main.cpp to class Monday.
