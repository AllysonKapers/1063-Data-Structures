but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest
quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley
of the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his
trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were
within and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up
from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands
winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in
their hill side blue but though the picture lies thus tranced and
though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this
shepherds head yet all were vain unless the shepherds eye were
fixed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june
when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep among
tiger lilieswhat is the one charm wantingwaterthere is not a drop
of water there! were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel
your thousand miles to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon
suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy
him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian
trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a
robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea
why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a
mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out
of sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did
the greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely
all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that
story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild
image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but that
same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image
of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all

now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin
to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my
lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a
passenger for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a
purse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passengers
get sea sickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdo not enjoy
themselves much as a general thingno i never go as a passenger
nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a
commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction
of such offices to those who like them for my part i abominate all
honorable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind
whatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself
without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not
and as for going as cookthough i confess there is considerable glory
in that a cook being a sort of officer on ship boardyet somehow i
never fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciously
buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who
will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled
fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old
egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the
mummies of those creatures in their huge bake houses the pyramids

no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast
plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal mast head
true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to
spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort of
thing is unpleasant enough it touches ones sense of honor
particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the
van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if
just previous to putting your hand into the tar pot you have been
lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand in
awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a
schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and
the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears off
in time

what of it if some old hunks of a sea captain orders me to get a broom
and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighed
i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the archangel
gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and
respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who aint
a slave tell me that well then however the old sea captains may
order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about i have the
satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is
one way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical or
metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is
passed round and all hands should rub each others shoulder blades
and be content

again i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of
paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single
penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must
pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and
being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable
infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but _being
paid_what will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man
receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly
believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no
account can a monied man enter heaven ah! how cheerfully we consign
ourselves to perdition!

finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome
exercise and pure air of the fore castle deck for as in this world
head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is if
you never violate the pythagorean maxim) so for the most part the
commodore on the quarter deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from
the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not
so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many
other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it but
wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a
merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling
voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the
constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me in
some unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else and
doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand
programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in
as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive
performances i take it that this part of the bill must have run
something like this:

_grand contested election for the presidency of the united states_
whaling voyage by one ishmael bloody battle in affghanistan

though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the
fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when
others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short
and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farcesthough i
cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all the
circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives
which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced
me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the
delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill
and discriminating judgment

chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my
curiosity then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island
bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all
the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds
helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things
would not have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an
everlasting itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and
land on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick to
perceive a horror and could still be social with itwould they let
mesince it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of
the place one lodges in

by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the
great flood gates of the wonder world swung open and in the wild
conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into
my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them
all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air


chapter 2 the carpet bag

i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpet bag tucked it under my
arm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city
of old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was a saturday night
in december much was i disappointed upon learning that the little
packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching
that place would offer till the following monday

as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at
this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well
be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind was
made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a
fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous
old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has
of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though
in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket
was her great originalthe tyre of this carthagethe place where the
first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket
did those aboriginal whalemen the red men first sally out in canoes
to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did
that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with
imported cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales in
order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the
bowsprit

now having a night a day and still another night following before me
in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a
matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a
very dubious looking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold
and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had
sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silverso
wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of
a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the
north with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you
may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to
inquire the price and dont be too particular
